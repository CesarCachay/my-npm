# This repository was created to practice how to build my own npm.

Using this package you will be able to use 4 methods where:

- You will be able to use concatJS & popJS I changed their names to make sure I exported this package properly
- You will be able to use 2 methods used in ruby those are "empty & capitalize" but I added JS in their names.
